>Millions of developer today turn to lightweight code editors and command-line centric development workflows as their primary application development environment.  With Visual Studio Code, we are introducing a new, free, cross-platform code editor for building modern web and cloud applications on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows, available in preview today.
